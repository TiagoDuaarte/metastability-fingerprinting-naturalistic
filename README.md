Hello, and welcome!

Welcome to this GitHub repository, where you’ll find the main code used to generate the data for the manuscript “Connectome Similarity Varies with Global Metastability and Movies’ Content.”

To keep this repository clean and focused, I’ve included only the three core R scripts developed for the project:

all_fingerprinting_measures – computes the Iself and Iothers indices

metastability_measure – computes metastability (as well as additional measures not reported in the manuscript)

all_measures_combined_for_networks – runs both sets of computations for a specific network

If you need scripts used for statistical models, figure generation, or if you have any questions about how to run or adapt the code, feel free to email me at tiago.duarte@aluno.ufabc.edu.br
 or teago.duarte@gmail.com
 — I’ll be very happy to help and guide you through the workflow.

A step-by-step tutorial covering all scripts is also available, written in a more pedagogical style (at least that was the intention!). Unfortunately, it’s currently only in Portuguese, but I plan to translate it soon.
